FireTV Utility<br>
Replaces previous utility adbfiretv<br>

Depends on afmt<br>

Decided to rewrite and a take a less-is-more approach. I'm much happier with this version.<br>

<b>Install Odin See:</b><br />
https://odin-lang.org/docs/<br />
<br />
<b>Compile with Odin:</b><br />
1. In the terminal, navigate to the folder where this code is located.<br />
2. odin build .<br />
<br />
<b>Install adb in Ubuntu:</b><br />
sudo apt install adb<br />
<br />
<b>Install adb in Windows:</b><br />
winget install Google.PlatformTools<br />
<br />
ADB (Android Debug Bridge) and Developer Options enabled in the FireOS is required.<br />
<br />
<b>Enable Developer Options in FireOS:</b><br />
1. Go to "Settings", "Device & Software", "About".<br />
2. Press "Your TV" seven times to unlock "Developer Options".<br />
3. Back up to "Device & Software", "Developer Options" should now show in the menu.<br />
4. Go to "Developer Options" and enable "ADB Debugging".<br />
5. When you connect for the first time to FireoS, ADB will fail, but an authorization window will popup on the TV.<br />
6. Check the box to allow the connection ID generated by ADB.<br />
7. After this, all future connections will be allowed from that specific computer<br />
